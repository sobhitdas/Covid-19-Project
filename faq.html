                        On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease
                        that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new
                        name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’
                        stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred
                        to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.

                        COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are a large family of
                        viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels,
                        cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between
                        people. This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19.
                        The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these
                        viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that
                        China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an
                        animal reservoir. However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.

                        but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.
                        There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated
                        with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.

                        CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose
                        and mouth when they are out in the community. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies
                        or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation. Children younger than 2 years
                        of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious,
                        incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.

                        Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread
                        of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other
                        everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may
                        prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important if
                        someone is infected but does not have symptoms. Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still
                        reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC
                        guidance.

                        try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe. If appropriate, explain to them that
                        most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild. Children respond differently to stressful
                        situations than adults. CDC offers resources to help talk with children about COVID-19.

                        CDC recommends handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, using alcohol-based
                        hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available. These actions
                        are part of everyday preventive actions individuals can take to slow the spread of respiratory
                        diseases like COVID-19.

                        When washing hands, you can use plain soap or antibacterial soap. Plain soap is as effective as
                        antibacterial soap at removing germs.
                        If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an FDA-approved alcohol-based hand
                        sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. You can tell if the sanitizer contains at least
                        60% alcohol by looking at the product label.
                        CDC does not encourage the production and use of homemade hand sanitizer products because of
                        concerns over the correct use of the ingredientsexternal iconexternal icon and the need to work
                        under sterile conditions to make the product. Local industries that are looking into producing
                        hand sanitizer to fill in for commercial shortages can refer to the World Health Organization
                        guidancepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal icon. Organizations should revert to the use of
                        commercially produced, FDA-approved product once such supplies again become available.

                        To be effective against killing some types of germs, hand sanitizers need to have a strength of
                        at least 60% alcohol and be used when hands are not visibly dirty or greasy.
                        Do not rely on “Do It Yourself” or “DIY” recipes based solely on essential oils or formulated
                        without correct compounding practices.
                        Do not use hand sanitizer to disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects. See CDC’s
                        information for cleaning and sanitizing your home.

                        COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe
                        disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and
                        people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for
                        severe illness from COVID-19.

                        Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:

                        People aged 65 years and older
                        People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility
                        People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled,
                        including:

                        People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma
                        People who have serious heart conditions
                        People who are immunocompromised
                        Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, smoking,
                        bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and
                        prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications
                        People with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥40)
                        People with diabetes
                        People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis
                        People with liver disease
